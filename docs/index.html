<p>
<b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for using
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>
together.  Its basic facilities include:

<ul>
<li> a parser for XML,
<li> a separate error-correcting parser for HTML,
<li> an XML validator,
<li> pretty-printers for XML and HTML.
</ul>

<p>
For processing XML documents, the following components are provided:
<ul>
<li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator library for generic XML document
    processing, including transformation, editing, and generation.
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's Show/Read
    classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary Haskell data as XML
    documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool (available from
    <a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
    <tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
    can automatically derive this class for you.
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD
    into equivalent Haskell types.
<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
    this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as normal
    typed values in programs, and to read and write them as human-readable
    XML documents.
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em> is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents,
    loosely based on the XPath and XQL query languages.
</ul>

<p>
<a href="HaXml/index.html">Detailed documentation of the HaXml APIs</a>
is generated automatically by Haddock directly from the source code.

<p>
An introduction to HaXml for people who know more about XML than
about Haskell can be found at
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters14.html">
IBM DeveloperWorks</a>.

<p>
A paper describing and comparing the generic Combinators with
the typed representation (DtdToHaskell/Xml2Haskell) is available here:
(12 pages of double-column A4)
<ul>
<li> <a href="icfp99.dvi">icfp99.dvi</a>     (LaTeX dvi format)
<li> <a href="icfp99.ps.gz">icfp99.ps.gz</a> (PostScript format - gzipped)
<li> <a href="icfp99.html">icfp99.html</a>   (HTML format)
</ul>

<p>
Some additional info about using the various facilities is here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="Combinators.html">Combinators</a>       (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Haskell2Xml.html">Haskell2Xml class</a> (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Xml2Haskell.html">DtdToHaskell tool</a> (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Xtract.html">Xtract tool</a>            (HTML format)
</ul>

<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li> Haskell2Xml generates Parameter Entity Declarations in the internal
     subset of the DTD, which don't conform to the strict well-formedness
     conditions of XML.  We think the constraint in question is spurious,
     and any reasonable XML tool ought to deal adequately with full PEs.
<li> DtdToHaskell generates the Haskell String type for DTD attributes
     that are of Tokenized or Notation Types in XML.  This may not be
     entirely accurate.
</ul>

<center><h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3></center>
<p>
To install HaXml, you must have a Haskell compiler: ghc-5.02 or
later, nhc98-1.14 or later.  You also need hmake-3.06 or later.
HaXml-1.06 does not currently support Hugs (but HaXml-1.05 does,
and we hope to re-introduce Hugs support again soon).  Use
<pre>
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</pre>
to configure, build, and install HaXml as a package for your compiler.
Afterwards, to gain access to the HaXml libraries, you only need to
add the option <tt>-package HaXml</tt> to your compiler commandline.
Various stand-alone tools are also built - DtdToHaskell, Xtract,
Validate - if you are going to use them, you should copy these to
your final preferred installation location by hand.

<center><h3><a name="news">Recent news</a></h3></center>
<p>
The latest version (1.06) has the following new features:<br>
<ul>
<li> HaXml now uses the new hierarchical namespace for modules,
     specifically under the tree <tt>Text.Xml.HaXml</tt>.
<li> The HaXml libraries now install as a separate `package' in both ghc
     and nhc98.  Use <em>-package HaXml</em> to access them.
<li> The library APIs are now documented using Haddock.
<li> Due to popular request, we have added a new validator for checking
     generic document content against a DTD.  This is available both as
     a library function, and as a command-line tool.
<li> DrIFT is now distributed separately by John Meacham, with much better
     configuration and build support.  You still only need it if you
     want to derive the <tt>Haskell2Xml</tt> class.
<li> Bugfix: the lexer and parser now accept NOTATION declarations in the DTD.
<li> Bugfix: a PublicId in a NOTATION decl is now correctly recognised by the
             keyword PUBLIC, not PUBLICID.
<li> Bugfix: the HTML parser now correctly accepts stand-alone tags like IMG.
<li> Bugfix: instances of XmlContent now accept an empty string where #PCDATA
             is expected.  Likewise, comments, processing instructions, and
             character/entity references are now permitted to be scattered
             thoughout some #PCDATA text.
<li> Bugfix: the OneOfN types used in code generated by DtdToHaskell are
             now supplied by default up to size 20, and a utility for
             automatically generating larger sizes is included.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Joe English has written a more space-efficient parser for XML
    in Haskell, called hxml.  What is more, it can be used as a simple
    drop-in replacement for the HaXml parser!
    <a href="http://www.flightlab.com/~joe/hxml/">Available here</a>.
<li>Some comparisons between functional language approaches to processing
    XML can be found in
    <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/02/14/functional.html">
    Bijan Parsia's article on xml.com</a>
<li>Christian Lindig has written an XML parser in O'Caml:
    <a href="http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/people/lindig/software/tony.html">
    here</a>.
<li>Andreas Neumann of the University of Trier has written a
    validating XML parser in Standard ML:
    <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~neumann/Fxp">here</a>.
<li>Erik Meijer and Mark Shields have a design for a functional programming
    language that treats XML documents as basic data types:
    <a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mbs/pub/xmlambda">XMLambda</a>.
<li>Benjamin Pierce and Haruo Hosoya have a different but similar design in
    <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~hahosoya/xduce/">XDuce</a>, which is
    also implemented.
<li>Ulf Wiger describes an Erlang toolkit for XML:
    <a href="http://www.erlang.se/euc/00/">XMerL</a>
<li>There is a comprehensive reading list for XML and web programming in
