<p>
<b>HaXml</b> is a collection of utilities for using
<a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml">XML</a>
together.  Its basic facilities include:

<ul>
<li> a parser for XML,
<li> a separate error-correcting parser for HTML,
<li> an XML validator,
<li> pretty-printers for XML and HTML.
</ul>

<p>
For processing XML documents, the following components are provided:
<ul>
<li><em>Combinators</em> is a combinator library for generic XML document
    processing, including transformation, editing, and generation.
<li><em>Haskell2Xml</em> is a replacement class for Haskell's Show/Read
    classes: it allows you to read and write ordinary Haskell data as XML
    documents.  The <em>DrIFT</em> tool (available from
    <a href="http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/">
    <tt>http://repetae.net/~john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/</tt></a>)
    can automatically derive this class for you.
<li><em>DtdToHaskell</em> is a tool for translating any valid XML DTD
    into equivalent Haskell types.
<li>In conjunction with the <em>Xml2Haskell</em> class framework,
    this allows you to generate, edit, and transform documents as normal
    typed values in programs, and to read and write them as human-readable
    XML documents.
<li>Finally, <em>Xtract</em> is a <em>grep</em>-like tool for XML documents,
    loosely based on the XPath and XQL query languages.  It can be used
    either from the command-line, or within your own code as part of the
    library.
</ul>

<center><h3><a name="how">How do I use it?</a></h3></center>
<p>
<a href="HaXml/index.html">Detailed documentation of the HaXml APIs</a>
is generated automatically by Haddock directly from the source code.

An introduction to HaXml for people who know more about XML than
about Haskell can be found at
<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters14.html">
IBM DeveloperWorks</a>.

<p>
A paper describing and comparing the generic Combinators with
the typed representation (DtdToHaskell/Xml2Haskell) is available here:
(12 pages of double-column A4)
<ul>
<li> <a href="icfp99.dvi">icfp99.dvi</a>     (LaTeX dvi format)
<li> <a href="icfp99.ps.gz">icfp99.ps.gz</a> (PostScript format - gzipped)
<li> <a href="icfp99.html">icfp99.html</a>   (HTML format)
</ul>

Some additional info about using the various facilities is here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="Combinators.html">Combinators</a>       (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Haskell2Xml.html">Haskell2Xml class</a> (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Xml2Haskell.html">DtdToHaskell tool</a> (HTML format)
<li> <a href="Xtract.html">Xtract tool</a>            (HTML format)
</ul>

<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<ul>
<li> To use <em>-package HaXml</em> interactively with GHCi, you need
     at least ghci-5.02.3.
<li> Haskell2Xml generates Parameter Entity Declarations in the internal
     subset of the DTD, which don't conform to the strict well-formedness
     conditions of XML.  We think the constraint in question is spurious,
     and any reasonable XML tool ought to deal adequately with full PEs.
<li> DtdToHaskell generates the Haskell String type for DTD attributes
     that are of Tokenized or Notation Types in XML.  This may not be
     entirely accurate.
</ul>

<center><h3><a name="install">Installation</a></h3></center>
<p>
To install HaXml, you must have a Haskell compiler: ghc-5.02 or
later, nhc98-1.14 or later.  You also need hmake-3.06 or later.
HaXml-1.08 does not currently support Hugs (but HaXml-1.05 does,
and we hope to re-introduce Hugs support again soon).  Use
<pre>
    ./configure
    make
    make install
</pre>
to configure, build, and install HaXml as a package for your compiler.
Afterwards, to gain access to the HaXml libraries, you only need to
add the option <tt>-package HaXml</tt> to your compiler commandline.
Various stand-alone tools are also built - DtdToHaskell, Xtract,
Validate - if you are going to use them, you should copy these to
your final preferred installation location by hand.

<p>
The latest version (1.08) has the following fixes:<br>
<ul>
<li> A new and highly useful function, Text.XML.HaXml.Validate.partialValidate,
     does validation except for checking whether the root element type matches
     that of the DTD's root element.  This is just what you need in order to
     validate any partial document or sub-document.
<li> The function Text.XML.HaXml.Html.Generate.htmlprint had a little
     bug which caused it to loop infinitely if some text was longer
     than 60 characters without a space.
<li> The Xtract parser and combinators are now included in the HaXml
     library package, rather than existing solely for the Xtract
     command-line tool.
<li> The code generated by DtdToHaskell had a minor cut-and-paste error.
<li> The file `script/echo.c' was missing from the distribution.
     This only affected the configuration step on systems where
     `echo -n' is not recognised (e.g. Solaris).
</ul>

<p>
Version (1.07) had the following new features:<br>
<ul>
<li> HaXml now uses the new hierarchical namespace for modules,
     specifically under the tree <tt>Text.XML.HaXml</tt>.
<li> The HaXml libraries now install as a separate `package' in both ghc
     and nhc98.  Use <em>-package HaXml</em> to access them.
<li> The library APIs are now documented using Haddock.
<li> Due to popular request, we have added a new validator for checking
     generic document content against a DTD.  This is available both as
     a library function, and as a command-line tool.
<li> DrIFT is now distributed separately by John Meacham, with much better
     configuration and build support.  You still only need it if you
     want to derive the <tt>Haskell2Xml</tt> class.
<li> Bugfix: the lexer and parser now accept NOTATION declarations in the DTD.
<li> Bugfix: a PublicId in a NOTATION decl is now correctly recognised by the
             keyword PUBLIC, not PUBLICID.
<li> Bugfix: the HTML parser now correctly accepts stand-alone tags like IMG.
<li> Bugfix: instances of XmlContent now accept an empty string where #PCDATA
             is expected.  Likewise, comments, processing instructions, and
             character/entity references are now permitted to be scattered
             thoughout some #PCDATA text.
<li> Bugfix: the OneOfN types used in code generated by DtdToHaskell are
             now supplied by default up to size 20, and a utility for
             automatically generating larger sizes is included.
