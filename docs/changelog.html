<h1>HaXml change log</h1>

<hr>

<h3>Changes for 1.06</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> HaXml now uses the new hierarchical namespace for modules,
     specifically under the tree <tt>Text.Xml.HaXml</tt>.
<li> The library APIs are now documented using Haddock.
<li> Due to popular request, we have added a new validator for checking
     generic document content against a DTD.
<li> DrIFT is now distributed separately by John Meacham, with much better
     configuration and build support.  You still only need it if you
     want to derive the <tt>Haskell2Xml</tt> class.
<li> Bugfix: the lexer and parser now accept NOTATION declarations in the DTD.
<li> Bugfix: a PublicId in a NOTATION decl is now correctly recognised by the
             keyword PUBLIC, not PUBLICID.
<li> Bugfix: the HTML parser now correctly accepts stand-alone tags like IMG.
<li> Bugfix: instances of XmlContent now accept an empty string where #PCDATA
             is expected.  Likewise, comments, processing instructions, and
             character/entity references are now permitted to be scattered
             thoughout some #PCDATA text.
<li> Bugfix: the OneOfN types used in code generated by DtdToHaskell are
             now supplied by default up to size 20, and a utility for
             automatically generating larger sizes is included.
</ul>

<p>
I didn't keep detailed changelogs for versions before 1.06, but
here are the highlights.

<h3>Changes for 1.05</h3>
<ul>
<li> In DtdToHaskell, fix some more bugs with empty PE References at the
     end of an element content specification.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.04</h3>
<ul>
<li> In DtdToHaskell, fix a bug whereby an empty PE Reference at the end
     of an element content specification caused a parse error - the DTD
     is now accepted.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.03</h3>
<ul>
<li> In DtdToHaskell, added tagname prefixes to the attribute names of
     enumeration types, to disambiguate when attributes of the same name
     have different value-sets within different tags.
<li> DtdToHaskell also now accepts Tokenized and Notation types, mapping
     them to Strings.
<li> Added an instance of Xml2Haskell for the Maybe type.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.02</h3>
<ul>
<li> Added instances of Haskell2Xml for Float and Double.
