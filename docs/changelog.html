<h3>Changes for 1.07b</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The code generated by DtdToHaskell had a minor cut-and-paste error.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.07a</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The file `script/echo.c' was missing from the distribution.
     This only affected the configuration step on systems where
     `echo -n' is not recognised (e.g. Solaris).
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.07</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The hierarchical namespace <tt>Text.Xml</tt> was incorrect.
     It should be <tt>Text.XML</tt>
<li> The ghc package now also works in GHCi (but only for ghci-5.02.3
     and later).
<li> If you have both ghc and nhc98 compilers available, the package
     is built for both.  However, now the <em>configure --buildwith=</em>
     option is available to choose to build for only one of them.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.06</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> HaXml now uses the new hierarchical namespace for modules,
     specifically under the tree <tt>Text.Xml.HaXml</tt>.
<li> The HaXml libraries now install as a separate `package' in both ghc
     and nhc98.  Use <em>-package HaXml</em> to access them.
<li> The library APIs are now documented using Haddock.
<li> Due to popular request, we have added a new validator for checking
     generic document content against a DTD.   This is available both as
     a library function, and as a command-line tool.
<li> DrIFT is now distributed separately by John Meacham, with much better
     configuration and build support.  You still only need it if you
     want to derive the <tt>Haskell2Xml</tt> class.
<li> Bugfix: the lexer and parser now accept NOTATION declarations in the DTD.
<li> Bugfix: a PublicId in a NOTATION decl is now correctly recognised by the
             keyword PUBLIC, not PUBLICID.
<li> Bugfix: the HTML parser now correctly accepts stand-alone tags like IMG.
<li> Bugfix: instances of XmlContent now accept an empty string where #PCDATA
             is expected.  Likewise, comments, processing instructions, and
             character/entity references are now permitted to be scattered
             thoughout some #PCDATA text.
<li> Bugfix: the OneOfN types used in code generated by DtdToHaskell are
             now supplied by default up to size 20, and a utility for
             automatically generating larger sizes is included.
</ul>

<p>
I didn't keep detailed changelogs for versions before 1.06, but
here are the highlights.

<h3>Changes for 1.05</h3>
<ul>
<li> In DtdToHaskell, fix some more bugs with empty PE References at the
     end of an element content specification.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.04</h3>
<ul>
<li> In DtdToHaskell, fix a bug whereby an empty PE Reference at the end
     of an element content specification caused a parse error - the DTD
     is now accepted.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.03</h3>
<ul>
<li> In DtdToHaskell, added tagname prefixes to the attribute names of
     enumeration types, to disambiguate when attributes of the same name
     have different value-sets within different tags.
<li> DtdToHaskell also now accepts Tokenized and Notation types, mapping
     them to Strings.
<li> Added an instance of Xml2Haskell for the Maybe type.
</ul>

<h3>Changes for 1.02</h3>
<ul>
<li> Added instances of Haskell2Xml for Float and Double.
