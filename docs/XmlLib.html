<p>
<b>XmlLib</b> is a combinator library for generating, editing, and
transforming XML documents in a generic setting.  It includes a small
library for functions specifically for generating HTML from XML.
Input files are parsed as HTML if the filename ends in .html or .htm -
otherwise they are parsed as XML.

<p>
<b>Usage:</b> <tt>import XmlLib</tt><br>

<p>
<b>Limitations</b><br>
Note that the combinator library defines the functions <tt>elm</tt> and
<tt>txt</tt> rather than the expected (<tt>elem</tt>
and <tt>text</tt>), to avoid a nasty name clash with a Prelude function.
