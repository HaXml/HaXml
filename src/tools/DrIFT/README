DriFT v1.1,  Haskell 98 Version
-------------------------

This tar file contains

Makefile			- to build DrIFT
*.hs,*.lhs			- DrIFT source code
example/			- simple example files to test DrIFT on.

Changes from original (1.0)
---------------------------
  (Changes by Malcolm.Wallace@cs.york.ac.uk, 1999)
Updated sources to Haskell 98.  Added derivation of class Binary and
class Haskell2Xml.  Changed Main.main to place results on stdout instead
of overwriting original file.  Have not tried using Makefile recently; I
use hmake instead.

Building DrIFT
---------------
just type
   hmake DrIFT

Installation
------------
copy the 'DrIFT' executable to somewhere on your path

set DERIVEPATH to the list of directories you wish to search for  for
modules / interfaces. 

DERIVEPATH is quite fussy about the format the list should take :-
* each path should be separated by ':'
* no space inserted anywhere
* no final '/' on the end of a path

e.g. 
good - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs

bad - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs/

Running DrIFT
--------------
